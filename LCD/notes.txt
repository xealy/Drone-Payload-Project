To edit .bashrc, use this command:
code ~/.bashrc

Uncomment these lines in "~/.bashrc" to display_ip on LCD on boot:
source /home/455Team/Documents/egh455-merged-env/bin/activate
python3 /home/455Team/Documents/EGH455-UAV-Project/LCD/display_ip.py &
export OPENBLAS_CORETYPE=ARMV8

Here's an additional script we might need to apppend to kill the on-boot LCD process to free up the pins ??
# Find the PID of the display_ip.py process
pid=$(pgrep -f display_ip.py)

# If the PID is found, kill the process
if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
    echo "Killing process with PID: $pid"
    kill $pid
else
    echo "No process found for display_ip.py"
fi
